# tessel-homekit

This is basically a fork of https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS which itself is a Node.js implememtation of HomeKit Accessory Server.

I am trying to get this running on [Tessel 2](https://tessel.io/). It's early WIP and attempts to provide a way to make the Tessel work with HomeKit.
